# analysis-of-bacterial-colonies

This program (**ColonyCalculation**) was created to help analyze the data collected from **SphereFlash** software. 
The anti-bacteria test is conducted according to JIS Z 2801:2010 standard.
This program's functions include calculating the average number of colonies in each sample and calculating the antibacterial activity (%). Moreover, when the count of colonies < 1, this program can automatically take it as 1 in accordance with the standard requirements.

## How to use this program
The use of this program is so easy.
1. Download v1.0.0 zip file from "release" and unzip. Open the "ColonyCalculation.exe"
2. Click ... button to select an Excel file (*.xlsx or *.xls) created by **SphereFlash** software. Its default name is "ExportedData.xlsx". We provide an example file in the "examples folder"
3. According to Part 5.6(b) in standard, the films on test pieces may have varied areas. Remember to fill in the value of film side length (cm)
4. Press "start" button, and the program can generate a new Excel file containing the average colony count of each sample, the actibacterial activity of each sample, the dilution factor, etc.

Note: We used the 50-Î¼L-linear mode for bacteria spiral, but the standard required 1 mL. So we multiply the number of viable bacteria by 20 (Part 5.7). And the U-value in generated file means the common logarithm (log10) of viable bacteria.
